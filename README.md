# Pair of employees who have worked together

A React + TypeScript + Vite application for finding pairs of employees who have worked together on projects for the longest periods.

The app allows you to:

- Upload a CSV file of employee project assignments.
- Automatically parse the data and calculate overlapping work periods.
- View results in an interactive Ant Design table.
- Highlight the pairs of employees with the most total days worked together.
